# Notrace.email Website Rewrite

This repository contains a full rewrite of the [notrace.email](https://notrace.email) website, rebuilt with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using the [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app) starter.

## About This Project

I am actively rewriting the notrace.email website to improve its code quality, structure, and performance, with the goal of contributing to the official dev team. This rewrite aims to modernize the codebase using best practices in Next.js development while maintaining the core functionality and design.

npm run dev
# or

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to load and optimize the sleek [Geist font](https://vercel.com/font), created by Vercel.
